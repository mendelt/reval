# Reval DSL rules

Rules can be written in the Reval DSL. Rules are written as simple expressions like;

```
// Rule name
i1 + i2
```

The first line contains a comment line, the second line contains the expression that makes up the rule. In this case it simply adds two integers, `1` written as `i1` and `2` written as `i2`.
